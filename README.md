This script takes the outdated Staples schedule and reads your shifts for a month, converting them into an ICS file for easy calendar integration. Two bookmarklets are provided, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your needs: one for generating the ICS file (bookmarklet.txt) and another for opening the Google Calendar import page after downloading the ICS file (googleCalBookmarklet.txt).

Special thanks to @nwcell for creating the ics.js library.

Follow these steps to use the script:

1. Open the `bookmarklet.txt` or `googleCalBookmarklet.txt` file in the repository.
2. Locate your browser's bookmark bar.
3. Right-click on the bookmark bar.
4. Select "Add Page" or "Add Bookmark" from the context menu.
5. Choose the bookmarklet you want to use:
   - If you prefer to only generate the ICS file, enter a name for the first bookmark, e.g., "Staples Schedule Download", and copy the contents of the `bookmarklet.txt` file.
   - If you want to open the Google Calendar import page after downloading the ICS file, enter a name for the second bookmark, e.g., "Google Calendar Import", and copy the contents of the `googleCalBookmarklet.txt` file.
6. Paste the copied contents into the URL field of the bookmark dialog.
7. Click "Save" or "Add" to finalize the creation of the selected bookmarklet.

Now you can quickly generate an ICS file of your Staples schedule and, if desired, import it to your Google Calendar using the bookmarklet of your choice.
