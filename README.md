# Staples Schedule To ICS

This script converts your outdated Staples schedule into an ICS file, which can be easily integrated with your calendar. The script provides two bookmarklets: one for generating the ICS file and another for opening the Google Calendar import page after downloading the ICS file.

## Usage

1. Open the `bookmarklet.txt` or `googleCalBookmarklet.txt` file in the repository.
2. Locate your browser's bookmark bar.
3. Right-click on the bookmark bar.
4. Select "Add Page" or "Add Bookmark" from the context menu.
5. Choose the bookmarklet you want to use:
   - If you prefer to only generate the ICS file, enter a name for the first bookmark, e.g., "Staples Schedule Download", and copy the contents of the `bookmarklet.txt` file.
   - If you want to open the Google Calendar import page after downloading the ICS file, enter a name for the second bookmark, e.g., "Google Calendar Import", and copy the contents of the `googleCalBookmarklet.txt` file.
6. Paste the copied contents into the URL field of the bookmark dialog.
7. Click "Save" or "Add" to finalize the creation of the selected bookmarklet.
